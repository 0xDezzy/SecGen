## Linux Extended ACLs

An *access control list (ACL)* is attached to an object (resource) and lists all the subjects (users / active entities) that are allowed access, along with the kind of access that is authorised.

We have explored standard Unix (POSIX) file permissions, which is an abbreviated (simplified) ACL. Modern Linux systems (and some other Unix-based systems) now have more complete (and complicated) **extended** ACL support, enabling .

Todo: windows includes deny rules

Set a file ACL on your mysecrets file, using the setfacl command:

```bash
setfacl -m u:student:r ~/mysecret
```

This grants the "student" user read access to the file.

Note that the stat program is not usually ACL aware, so won't report anything out of the usual:

```bash
stat ~/mysecret
```

The ls program can be used to detect File ACLs:

```bash
ls -la ~/mysecret
```

`-rw-r-----+ 1 cliffe users 22 Feb 28 11:47 mysecrets`

Note that the output includes a `+`. This indicates an ACL is in place.

Use getfacl to display the permissions:

```bash
getfacl ~/mysecret
```

Use Linux File ACLs to grant one or more specific users (other class members) read access to your mysecrets file.

Using ACLs, grant any other group (you choose) read-write access to your mygroupshare file.

Remove the group permission you just added.

> Example: `setfacl -x g:staff file`
