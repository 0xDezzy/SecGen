# Authentication

## Getting started
### VMs in this lab

==Start these VMs== (if you haven't already):
- hackerbot_server (leave it running, you don't log into this)
- desktop

### Your login details for the "desktop" and "server" VMs
User: <%= $main_user %>
Password: tiaspbiqe2r (**t**his **i**s **a** **s**ecure **p**assword **b**ut **i**s **q**uite **e**asy **2** **r**emember)

You won't login to the hackerbot_server, but the VM needs to be running to complete the lab.

### For marks in the module
1. **You need to submit flags**. Note that the flags and the challenges in your VMs are different to other's in the class. Flags will be revealed to you as you complete challenges throughout the module. Flags look like this: ==flag{*somethingrandom*}==. Follow the link on the module page to submit your flags.
2. **You need to document the work and your solutions in a Log Book**. This needs to include screenshots (including the flags) of how you solved each Hackerbot challenge and a writeup describing your solution to each challenge, and answering any "Log Book Questions". The Log Book will be submitted later in the semester.

## Meet Hackerbot!
![small-right](images/skullandusb.svg)

This exercise involves interacting with Hackerbot, a chatbot who will attack your system. If you satisfy Hackerbot by completing the challenges she will reveal flags to you.

**On the desktop VM:**

==Open Pidgin and send some messages to Hackerbot:==

- Try asking Hackerbot some questions
- Send "help"
- Send "list"
- Send "hello"
> If Hackerbot seems to be waiting/halted, simply say 'hi'

Work through the below exercises, completing the Hackerbot challenges as noted.

## Introduction to authentication

Authentication plays the important role of verifying an identity. For example, when someone gets into an airplane, sits down at a computer, picks up a mobile device, or uses a website, authentication is what is used to confirm that the person is who they claim to be. Authentication is an important first step *before* deciding how the system should act and what to allow.

### Identity: users and groups

Most computer systems have the concept of a user account. Although some devices such as mobile phones typically only have one user account, most modern computers can support having multiple users, each with their own identity. For example, a computer can have a separate account for each person that uses it, and if configured to do so may enable each user to have their own account preferences, and access to different resources.

On Unix/Linux systems every user account is identified by a user ID number (UID), which is a 32-bit integer (whole number), and can have one or more user names, which are human readable strings of text.

Open a terminal console.

> One way to do this is to start Konsole from KDEMenu

Assuming you have already logged in, you have already authenticated yourself on this system.

==Log Book Question: When and how did you authenticate yourself?==

Use these commands to find out about your current identity (or more accurately the identity of the software you are interacting with):

```bash
whoami

groups

id
```

==Make a note of your UID and username.==

Note that your account is also a member of one or more groups. A primary group, and a list of other groups. Some Linux systems, such as Debian, create a new seperate primary group for each user, others such as openSUSE have a shared group (named "users") that all normal users are a member of. Similar to the relationship between user names and UIDs, each group has a group name, and a group ID (GID).

Information about user accounts is stored in the /etc/passwd file, which typically all users can read.

==View the /etc/passwd file:==

```bash
less /etc/passwd
```

==Find the line that describes your user account.==

This line defines the username, password (well, it used to be stored hereâ€¦ we will come back to this), UID, primary group GID, full name, home directory, and shell for your account.

Confirm this matches the information you recorded earlier.

==Find the line that describes the root user account.==

Where is the root user's home directory?

> Press 'q' to quit less.

==View the /etc/group file:==

```bash
less /etc/group
```

Groups are defined in this file, along with which users are members.

==Which users are members of the "tftp" group?

Remember, primary groups do not appear in this file; for example, on openSUSE the "users" group, which all normal users are a member of, may not appear in the /etc/group file.

The "su" program can be used to run a program (usually a shell; that is, a command prompt) as another user, effectively enabling users to switch between user accounts at the command prompt.

==Change your identity to root==. Run:

```bash
su -
```

Enter the root password.

Use these commands to ==find out about your new identity:==

```bash
whoami

groups

id
```

==What is the UID of root? What does this mean about this user?==

==Lab Book Question: What gives this user special privileges: the name of the account, or the UID?==

==Use the useradd command to create a new user account "fred"==

> Hint: refer to the man page for useradd, by running "man useradd".

==Set a password for the user fred.==

> Hint: `sudo passwd fred`

==Change identity to fred.==

> Hint: `su - fred`

==Run:(after su)==

```bash
id
```

==Compare the result to the previous output.==

==How does this compare to your other normal user account? What is different, and what about it is the same?==

Run the single command "id" as root:

```bash
sudo id
```

==Log Book Question: What is the difference between sudo and su? Which is most likely protect against accidental damage and also log the commands used?==

### Users and SSH

==Log in to the server via ssh:==

```bash
ssh <%= $main_user %>@<%= $server_ip %>
```

==Display details of all users logged on to the system:==

```bash
who
```

==List all the processes run by all users:==

```bash
ps -eo user,comm
```

==List all the processes running as root:==

```bash
ps -o user,comm -u root
```

==Run a command to list all the processes running as *your* normal user.==

==Lab Book Question: How is this server authenticating users? What user accounts exist?==

### Passwords, hashes and salt

Given that important security decisions are made based on the user accounts, it is important to authenticate users, to ensure that the subjects are associated with the correct identity.

==What are the kinds of factors that can be used to verify a user's identity? Hint: for example, "something they have".==

==Which category of authentication factors is a password considered to be?==

Originally passwords were stored "in the clear" (not enciphered). For example, Multics stored passwords in a file, and once at MIT a software bug caused the password file to be copied to the motd file (message of the day), which was printed every time anyone logged into the system. A solution is not to store the password in the clear. Instead a hash can be computed, using a one way hash function, and stored. When the user enters a password, a new hash is computed and compared to the original.

On Linux, the command "shasum" can be used to check the integrity of files (hash functions have many uses), and works on the same principle. We can use it to generate a hash for any given string, for example a password:

```bash
shasum
```

> Type "hello" without the quotes. Press Ctrl-D (which indicates "EOF"; that is, end of input).

Repeat the above, with the same password ("hello"), and with a slight difference ("hello.").

Are the outputs the same?

Are the different hashes similar?

Is this good? Why?

Which one-way hash function does the shasum program use? Would this be a good option for hashing passwords?

For password authentication, the hash still needs to be stored. On Unix, password hashes were once stored in the world-readable file /etc/passwd, now they are typically stored in /etc/shadow, which only root (the superuser) can access.

==View the shadow file:==

```bash
sudo less /etc/shadow
```

The format of the shadow file is:

> username:**password**:last-changed(since 1-1-1970):days-until-may-change:days-until-must-change:days-warning-notice:days-since-expired-account-disabled:date-disable:reserved-field

==Find the hash of your user account's password.==

> Exit less ("q").

Use the passwd command to ==change your password:==

```bash
passwd
```

> When prompted, enter a new password of your choosing.

View the shadow file, and confirm that the stored password has changed.

With reference to the shadow file, and the man page for crypt (Hint: "man crypt"), ==answer these Log Book questions==:

-   On Linux, the password hash stored in /etc/shadow has a prefix that specifies the hash function used.\
    > ==What hash function is used for your password?==

-   ==When was the root password last changed?==

-   ==Do any accounts have a setting that will force a password change at a specific date?==

A salt is a random string, used as further input into a one-way hash function (concatenated to the password). The salt is typically stored along with the hash. As a result the same password will have different hashes, so long as the salt is different.

Why is that a good thing?

What kind of attack does a salt defend against?

What is the current salt for your account? Hint: it is stored after the second "\$".

### Password weaknesses

The strength of a password depends on its entropy: its degree of randomness. If a user chooses a word from a dictionary, it would not take long to attempt every dictionary word until finding one that results in the same hash.

Try your hand at cracking passwords using the Kali virtual machine.

Add some new users with these passwords:
> Hello
>
> hellothere
>
> H3ll0
>
> hello1
>
> 12hell012356

==Use john the ripper to crack the passwords.==
> Hint: `man john`, on the Kali Linux system.

### Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)

In the past all Linux/Unix programs that required the user to enter a password for authentication (such as su, sudo, and login) would access and interpret /etc/passwd using its own code. However, it was hard to maintain all this code, since any change in the way the passwords were stored (such as using a shadow file, or using new hash functions) would mean all the software that provides authentication needed to be changed. The solution to the problem was PAM.

*Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)* enables applications that make use of authentication to be independent of the specific authentication schemes in use. For example, a program such as a login screen that uses PAM can be configured to authenticate using a password, smartcard, and/or biometrics, simply by changing PAM configuration files.

PAM is supported in most distributions of Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and many other Unix-like systems.

View which PAM modules are available on the desktop system:

> /usr/sbin/pam-config --list-modules

The .so files are typically in /lib/security or /lib64/security. List them:

> ls /lib\*/security/

As you can see, there are lots of different features and authentication schemes, and these can be used with *any* PAM compatible program. This includes not only typical authentication schemes, such as pam\_unix2.so, which does the usual password comparison with /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, but also can impose time limits (pam\_time.so) or simply display messages to the user (pam\_motd.so).

It is possible to determine whether a specific program is compiled to use PAM, by checking what dynamic libraries it uses. (On Linux .so shared objects are similar to DLL files on Windows, they contain library code that programs can reuse). Check what shared objects the passwd program uses:

```bash
which passwd
>
> ldd *path\_to\_passwd*
```

> Where path\_to\_password is the output from the "which passwd" command above, which identifies the absolute path to a program. For example, `ldd /usr/bin/passwd`

Note that the output will include a line starting with "libpam.so", such as:

> **libpam.so**.0 =&gt; /lib64/libpam.so.0 (0x00007fcc4afe6000)

This would indicate that the program loads code from "/lib64/libpam.so.0", and does indeed make use of PAM.

PAM configuration is located in /etc/pam.d. Take a look at which programs currently have pam configuration files:

```bash
ls /etc/pam.d
```

Depending on what is installed on the system, there will be a few configuration files. Each file contains a PAM configuration for the program it is named after. If a PAM-aware program does not have a configuration file the "other" file is used, which should deny access by default.

View the "other" file:

```bash
less /etc/pam.d/other
```

![](media/image2.png){width="3.53125in" height="2.0416666666666665in"}

The output contains instructions to log the attempt to Syslog (which is what pam\_warn.so does) and deny access (using pam\_deny.so) any attempt to authenticate (the lines starting with "auth"), request access to anything (account), change passwords (password), or starting a session (session).

The syntax of the configuration file is that each line starts with is typically:

> *type control module-path module-arguments*

The type is auth, password, account or session. The control (such as "required" or "optional") defines whether the module needs to pass or not before moving on to the next module, then the module name is defined. It is not shown in this example, but the module-path can be followed with some settings for the module.

All the modules for a type (such as auth) are called a module stack. When the program requests PAM perform authentication each of the auth modules in the module stack are run in the order they appear. If a "required" module fails, the authentication process tries the next module to see if it passes, if no required modules pass, then the authentication fails. Note that in the example above, pam\_warn.so returns "PAM\_IGNORE". Therefore the next module pam\_deny.so is started, which returns an error, and the authentication fails.

Possible control values include:

> **required**
>
> failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to the PAM-API returning failure but only after the remaining stacked modules (for this service and type) have been invoked.
>
> **requisite**
>
> like required, however, in the case that such a module returns a failure, control is directly returned to the application.
>
> **sufficient**
>
> success of such a module is enough to satisfy the authentication requirements of the stack of modules (if a prior required module has failed the success of this one is ignored). A failure of this module is not deemed as fatal to satisfying the application that this type has succeeded. If the module succeeds the PAM framework returns success to the application immediately without trying any other modules.
>
> **optional**
>
> the success or failure of this module is only important if it is the only module in the stack associated with this service+type.
>
> **include**
>
> include all lines of given type from the configuration file specified as an argument to this control.
>
> -- from the man page for pam.conf

There is also a more complex rule syntax available, described in the man page.

Information about each module is available in The Linux-PAM System Administrators' Guide:

> [*http://linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM\_SAG.html*](http://linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html)

Look at which authentication methods are used by passwd:

```bash
less /etc/pam.d/passwd
```

Note that this indicates that PAM will apply the rules in "/etc/pam.d/common-auth", "common-account", "common-password", and "common-session" for the passwd program.

Edit the rules in common-password:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/pam.d/common-password
```

Edit the line (adding "minlen=10" to the end of the line):

> password requisite pam\_cracklib.so **minlen=10**

**Reminder**: Vi is 'modal': it has an insert mode, where you can type text into the file, and normal mode, where what you type is interpreted as commands. Press the "i" key to enter "insert mode". Type your changes to the file, then exit back to "normal mode" by pressing the Esc key. Now to exit and save the file press the ":" key, followed by "wq" (write quit), and press Enter.

Change a password using passwd.

Confirm that normal users can no longer use a password that is less than 10 characters long.

View the man page for this PAM module[^1]:

```bash
man pam_cracklib
```

Based on the options described in the man page, configure the pam\_cracklib module to require at least one non-alphanumeric character.

Confirm that normal users can no longer use passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters.

Note that there is likely no lockout for failed password attempts when using su to change user. Confirm this by running this command a few times:

```bash
su - student; su - student; su - student; su - student;
```

When prompted each time, enter an incorrect password.

Now, let's assume our aim is to add a 5 minute lockout time for when a user enters the wrong password 3 times in a row when using "su". Log-tally lockouts can be achieved using pam\_tally2.

View the man page for this PAM module:

```bash
man pam\_tally2
```

Edit /etc/pam.d/su-l, and insert this line as the first module (after the comment at the start of the file):

auth required pam\_tally2.so deny=3 unlock\_time=300

Verify that this change has been successful by running the following command again:

```bash
su - student; su - student; su - student; su - student;
```

Enter the wrong password the first 3 times, and then the correct password on the 4th attempt.

Create a new user named "dropbear".

Finally, apply what you have learned to **configure PAM to only allow:**

-   **The user "dropbear" to login between 9am and 5pm**

-   **And only on a Tuesday**

For testing purposes add another rule that allows a user to log in only 10 minutes from the current time

> Hint: use pam\_time.so and edit /etc/security/time.conf (and read the documentation in the configuration file to figure out how to set the correct limits)
>
> Another hint: try the "account" type.

Configure a cron job to force the user to logout at the end of their allowed time

> Hint: as root, "crontab -e" and add a job to run at 5pm on Tuesday killing all of their processes
>
> For example, to disconnect dropbear on Wednesday at 4pm, add this line to cron (run "crontab -e", then press "i" to add):
>
> 00 16 \* root \* wed skill-KILL-u dropbear
>
> Try to figure out how to also send a warning to the user 10 minutes before they are kicked off (Hint: add another cron job, you could send a message via "wall", etc)

### securetty and security

Backup the "securetty" file, which specifies which virtual terminals root is allowed to login to:

```bash
cp /etc/securetty /etc/securetty.backup
```

Edit /etc/securetty and place a "\#" in front of "tty3"

Press Ctrl-Alt-F3 and try to login as root

Press Ctrl-Alt-F4 and try to login as root

Press Ctrl-Alt-F7 to return to the desktop

### Conclusion

At this point you have:

- Applied authentication concepts to Unix/Linux

- Experimented with user accounts and identity

- Experimented with one-way hash functions, salts, and password storage

- Cracked passwords with low entropy using dictionary attacks

- Configured PAM to apply various authentication techniques to programs such as passwd

Well done!

[^1]: Yes, this makes it a "Pluggable Authentication Modules module", an unfortunate redundancy...
