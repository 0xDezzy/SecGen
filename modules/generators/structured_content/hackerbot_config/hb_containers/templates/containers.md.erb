Introduction to Sandboxing and Isolation
There are many reasons for not trusting software: the authors may have been designed the software to act maliciously (malware) or they may have made some design or implementation mistakes that make the software vulnerable to attack. This is where access controls come in. Access controls restrict what each subject on a system is authorised to do. Traditionally access controls (such as Unix file permissions, which are user-oriented) have focussed on restricting what each user on a system can do. However, over time this has proven to be insufficient since this means that every program on a system is trusted with all of a user’s authorisation: any program can read or delete all of a user’s personal documents, Web history, and so on.
Sandboxing (or application-oriented access controls) involves restricting what a program or group of programs can do. This can significantly improve the security of a system since a rogue program can do far less damage to the system if it is restricted to only the permissions it requires to function correctly.
One approach to sandboxing is to run applications in isolated environments, with only access to resources (such as files) that are accessible from within the sandbox.
